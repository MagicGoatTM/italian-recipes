        <p>The translation for tiramisu is “pick me up”, and after devouring a slice (or a few), the hit of chocolate and coffee will definitely have you feeling perky!</p>
        
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>5 Free-range extra-large eggs</li>

            <li>Icing sugar</li>
            <li>A few squares of roasted almond dark chocolate (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Utensils:</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Pyrex/tray approx 23×33 cm size</li>
            <li>2 medium mixing bowls </li>
            <li>1 medium-size pot</li>
            <li>Cooking thermometer </li>
            <li>Hand mixer</li>
            <li>Spatula/li>
            <li>Chocolate shaver</li>
            <li>Small sifter</li>
            <li>Knife (to cut tiramisu)</li>
            <li>Plastic wrap</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>This Italian Tiramisu has absolutely no alcohol, making what I consider a tastier dessert. Separate the egg yolks and egg whites into two mixing bowls to get started. </li>
            <li>Next, we are going to pasteurize the eggs. Heat water until it begins to boil in a pot, then switch off the heat. (The steam from this will help heat the eggs!)</li>
            <li>Start with placing the bowl of yolks on top of the pot and use a hand mixer to gently whisk them until they reach maximum 60°C/140°F (about 1-2 minutes). Use a thermometer to get the most accurate temperature.</li>
            <li>Remove the bowl from the pot and add five tablespoons of white sugar to then continue mixing until light and frothy.</li>
            <li>Now, heat the egg whites over the hot water until you get stiff peaks.</li>
            <li>Add the mascarpone into the yolks and mix until you get a beautiful thick cream for the Italian tiramisu.</li>
            <li>Fold in the egg whites gently with a spatula to keep them from deflating. </li>
            <li>Next dip the Savoiardi biscuits (Lady fingers) in the cold coffee. Submerge each biscuit in the coffee for three seconds, letting the excess drip off.</li>
            <li>Add the dipped biscuits to the bottom of the pyrex pan with the sugar side down.</li>
            <li>Repeat until there is a single layer of biscuits in the baking dish; squish them in slightly if needed.</li>
            <li>Pour a thin layer of the mascarpone cream mixture on top, spreading with a spatula from corner to corner.</li>
            <li>Sift cocoa powder on top of the chocolate shavings, then repeat the layers, lining up the second layer of biscuits with the first.</li>
            <li>Break apart the rest of the chocolate for a topping for the Italian tiramisu, then sift the cocoa powder, covering the whole top of the Italian tiramisu.</li>
            <li>Cover with cling wrap and set in the fridge for four hours minimum – overnight will give you even better results.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>How to serve:</h4>
